# Number Theory, but in julia
Learning Julia by doing my Number Theory Initiation Sutff. As an undergraduate student I study mostly by the book [A Primer of Analytic Number Theory - From Pythagoras to Riemann](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/primer-of-analytic-number-theory/65F3F8B1F36996F60092ED7F655F0CB3).
